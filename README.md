Blender Development Environment

## Getting started
Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed and typing `python` into your commandline points to that installation.

Simply copy the example_addons.json and name the copy addons.json. Then adjust to where you have the repository for each addon or startup script and you're good to go!

Check the blender.bat to make sure you're pointing at your Blender executable.
